#### Formly Flex Manager

![CI](https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-integrations-manager/workflows/CI/badge.svg) ![GitHub release (latest SemVer including pre-releases)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/newrelic/nr1-integrations-manager?include_prereleases&sort=semver) [![Snyk](https://snyk.io/test/github/newrelic/nr1-integrations-manager/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/github/newrelic/nr1-integrations-manager)

## Usage

Use the Integrations Manager to simplify the work of deploying first class product integrations, and developing and deploying new integrations that are built using [`Flex`](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-flex).

> _Flex is an agnostic, all-in-one integration that makes sending data to New Relic from third party sources easier than ever._
